            <h2>What is Akan Name...</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Akan </strong>people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.
                Birthday names or <em>Kradin</em> literally translated as a “soul” name, which Akan beliefs
                suggest is the name the soul offers a person. That becomes the person’s first name,
                which is derived from the names of deities and their
                particular days of worshipping. These are the seven days of the week, with their male
                and female versions respectively—Kwasi or Akwasi (Akosua - Sunday); Kwadwo or
                Kojo/Adwoa - Monday; Kwabena/Abena (Tuesday); Kwaku/Akua (Wednesday);
                Yaw/Yaa (Thursday); Kofi/Afia or Afua; and Kwame/Amma. Some of the prominent
                Akan personalities such as <em>Kwame Nkrumah</em>, <em>Kofi Annan</em>, and <em>Nana Yaa Asantewaah </em>all have birthday names. Kwame
                Nkrumah was born on Saturday and Kofi Annan on Friday. The Akan are one of the
                few known ethnic groups that name people in this manner, which identifies them as a
                group. The practice is so entrenched in the culture that deities, God himself, and the
                earth all have birthday names. The Akan believe that God created himself on a
                Saturday and it is common among the Akan to refer to God as Oboo Adee Kwame
                (Creator Kwame), Twieduampong Kwame (Almighty Kwame), Ode ne ho Kwame
                (Kwame who owns himself), Osoro hene Kwame (Kwame of the Heavens),
                Odomankoma Kwame (Kwame the one who gives grace), to name just a few. It should
                be noted that by assigning the male name to God implies that God is a male in Akan
                belief systems.</p>
